Parse::Eyapp (Extended yapp) is a collection of modules that extends Francois
Desarmenien Parse::Yapp 1.05.  Eyapp extends yacc/yapp syntax with
functionalities like named attributes, EBNF-like expressions, modifiable
default action (like L<Parse::RecDescent> autoaction), grammar reuse, 
automatic abstract syntax tree building,
syntax directed data generation,
translation schemes, tree regular
expressions, tree transformations, scope analysis support, directed acyclic
graphs and a few more. 

Parse-Eyapp LALR parsing engine provides mechanisms for the I<dynamic resolution>
(i.e. at parsing time and not at grammar compilation time) of shift-reduce and 
reduce-reduce conflicts that can not be satisfactorily solved
using static precedences.  Parse-Eyapp also provide means to solve the problem of 
languages where the token's type depends upon contextual information like in
the well known PL/I statement:

         if then=if then if=then

The parser for the C<Eyapp> language
was written and generated
using C<Parse::Eyapp> and the C<eyapp> compiler (actually
the first version 
was bootstrapped using the L<yapp|Parse::Yapp> compiler).
The Eyapp program parsing the C<Eyapp> language
is in the file C<Parse/Eyapp/Parse.yp> 
in the C<Parse::Eyapp> distribution.
Therefore C<Parse::Eyapp::Parse> 
objects have all the methods in C<Parse::Eyapp::Driver>.

A C<Parse::Eyapp::Parse> is nothing but a particular kind of C<Parse::Eyapp>
parser: I<the one that parses> C<Eyapp> I<grammars>.

\begin{abstract}
Parse::Eyapp (Extended yapp) is a collection of modules
that extends Francois Desarmenien Parse::Yapp 1.05.
Eyapp extends yacc/yapp syntax with 
functionalities like named attributes,
EBNF-like expressions, modifiable default action,
automatic abstract syntax tree building,
dynamic conflict resolution,
translation schemes, tree regular expressions,
tree transformations, scope analysis support,
and directed acyclic graphs among others.
This article teaches you the basics of 
Compiler Construction and Parse::Eyapp by
building a translator from infix expressions to Parrot 
Intermediate Representation.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
There is a shortage of compiler toolkits in CPAN/Perl 5.
It will be beneficial to have a CPAN wider covering of 
translator components: attribute grammars, tree
transformations tools 
and code generator generators (see iburg \cite{iburg}).


This work presented \code{Parse::Eyapp}, a work in progress in that direction.
\code{Yacc} and \code{Parse::Yapp} programmers will feel at home
in \code{Parse::Eyapp}. 
Additionally to the beneficial mature approach to parsing provided by
\code{Yacc}-like parser generators,
\code{Parse::Eyapp} delivers a set of extensions
that give support to the later phases
of text processing.

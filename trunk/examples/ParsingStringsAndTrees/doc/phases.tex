The code below 
(file \verb|src/infix2pir.pl|) %
displays
the stages of the translator: \emph{Lexical
and syntax analysis, tree transformations
and decorations,
address assignments, code generation
and peephole optimization}. The simplicity of the 
considered language (no types, no control structures) 
permits the skipping of 
\emph{context handling} (also called \emph{semantic analysis}).
Context handling includes jobs like \emph{type checking}, 
\emph{live analysis}, etc.
Don't get overflowed for so much terminology:
The incoming sections will
explain in more detail each of these phases.
\begin{verbatim}
my $filename = shift;
my $parser = Infix->new(); 

# read input
$parser->slurp_file($filename);

# lexical and syntax analysis
my $t = $parser->YYParse();

# tree transformations:
# machine independent optimizations
$t->s(our @algebra);  

# Address Assignment 
our $reg_assign;
$reg_assign->s($t);

# Translate to PARROT
$t->bud(our @translation);

# variable declarations
my $dec = build_dec();

peephole_optimization($t->{tr});

output_code(\$t->{tr}, \$dec);
\end{verbatim}

The compiler uses the parser for infix expressions
that was generated from the Eyapp grammar  \verb|Infix.eyp|
(see section \ref{section:syntacticanalysis})
using the command:
\begin{verbatim}
$ eyapp Infix.eyp
$ ls -tr | tail -1
Infix.pm
\end{verbatim}
It also uses the module containing different families of tree
transformations that are described in the \verb|I2PIR.trg| file 
(explained in 
sections \ref{section:machineindependentoptimizations} and \ref{section:codegeneration}): 
\begin{verbatim}
$ treereg -m main I2PIR.trg
$ ls -tr | tail -1
I2PIR.pm
$ head -1 I2PIR.pm
package main;
\end{verbatim}
The option \verb|-m main| tells \verb|treereg|
to place the generated tree transformations inside the \verb|main|
namespace. Is in this file that the variables 
\verb|@algebra|, \verb|@translation| and 
\verb|$reg_assign| used during the machine-independent optimization,
code generation and register allocation phases are defined.
